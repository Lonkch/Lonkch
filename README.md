## Keyboard Shortcuts
Shortcuts I frequently use:
- Ctrl-Shift-T (re-open tabs)
- Ctrl-F (find words in tab)
- Alt-Tab (quickly switch between windows)

Shortcuts I would like to start using:
- Ctrl-Y (redo action)
- Win-D (quick access to desktop)
- Ctrl-W (close whatever you are currently looking at)
